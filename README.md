# BRFSS2016
Since my interactive graphs are rendered in Java, for best viewing experience use nbviewer to view my github page. 
Here is a link you can navigate to:
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pmleffers/BRFSS2016/blob/master/BRFSS%20notebook.ipynb

Otherwise you can click on my Jupyter Notebook link above to see the project.
